<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><i>These are notes from the Chapter 1 from the book "<a href="https://books.google.de/books?id=5KlQAAAAMAAJ">Software        Architecture: Perspective on an Emerging Discipline", by Mary Shaw        and David <span class="SpellE">Garlan</span>, Prentice Hall, 1996</a>.</i><br /><ul><li>Software Architecture becomes most important part in Software Engineering;<br />What is Software Architecure? It is not the same as design. We could say it 'high level design', but it is also still not the same. Software Architecture is <span style="font-weight: bold;">components + interactions</span>, but also design <span style="font-weight: bold;">decisions</span>, the decisions why such design gives better quality than the other;</li><li>It is not <span style="font-weight: bold;">functionality </span>that is important, but the <span style="font-weight: bold;">quality</span>; this is because we want to<br />- to deal with complexity and ease debugging<br />- to support reuse<br />- ...</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Software Engineering</span>, in turn, is a <span style="font-weight: bold;">routine</span> (which means a repeatative process); Software Architecture is one of the artifacts produced by Software Engineering; another artifact can be the code itself; Software Engineering deals with the following things:<br />- solving a customer's problem<br />- with certain resource limit (e.g. the money)<br />- by applying a systematic approach (repeatable process)</li></ul><br />* the routine is for <span style="font-weight: bold;">cotrolling the workers </span>who just want to do the work and go home; having only scientists and PhDs would be ideal case but not real life;<br />* proper architecture gives <span style="font-weight: bold;">80% chance </span>that the program will succeed<br />* <span style="font-weight: bold;">folklore </span>- when people tell their colleagues about some way of doing something, and it spreads in this informal way<br />* there was an attempt to introduce <span style="font-weight: bold;">licenses for Software Engineers</span> but it didn't succeed as people didn't take it seriously - no one really trusts software<br />* for example in <span style="font-weight: bold;">NASA </span>they have <span style="font-weight: bold;">voting system</span>, i.e. 3-5 computers run exactly the same program simultaneously</div>
