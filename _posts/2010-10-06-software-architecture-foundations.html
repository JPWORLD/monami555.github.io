<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><i>These are my notes from the Chapter 1 from the book "<a href="http://www.softwarearchitecturebook.com/">Software Architecture: Foundations, Theory and Practice</a>".</i><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">1.1 The power of analogy: the architecture of buildings</span><br /><br />* architecture = design and construction of buildings<br />The analogy between design and construction of buildings and d. and c. of software is strong, and textbooks typically use it as example.<br /><br /><br /><table style="height: 193px; width: 644px;"><tbody><tr><td style="font-weight: bold;">building</td><td style="font-weight: bold;">software</td></tr><tr><td>1. collecting requirements</td><td>1. specifying requirements</td></tr><tr><td>2. creating design to satisfy requirements</td><td>2. creating high-level design</td></tr><tr><td>3. refine design to create blueprints</td><td>3. developing detailed algorithms based on this design</td></tr><tr><td>4. construction based on blueprints</td><td>4. implementing algorithms</td></tr><tr><td>5. building is occupied and used</td><td>5. deploying and using the system</td></tr></tbody></table><br />What is similar: the focus is the <span style="font-weight: bold;">satisfaction </span>of future occupant's needs; allows for <span style="font-weight: bold;">specialization </span>of labour (designer is different from contractor); it has many <span style="font-weight: bold;">intermediate</span> points;<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Deeper insights:</span><br />- architecture is separate from, but <span style="font-weight: bold;">linked </span>to, physical structure (building/software); two architectures can be compared, described, discussed<br />- properties of structures are <span style="font-weight: bold;">induced by </span>the design of their architectures (eg. medieval castle)<br />- recognition of the distinctive role and character of an <span style="font-weight: bold;">architect</span><br />- <span style="font-weight: bold;">architecture </span>is more central focus than the process, process just serves<br />- architecture has matured over the years into a <span style="font-weight: bold;">discipline</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Architectural styles</span> are captured from experience and lessions from previous generations of architects.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Limitations of the analogy:</span><br />- we have good <span style="font-weight: bold;">intuition </span>for how buildings should be designed, but not for software<br />- it's harder to see the software architecture (software is <span style="font-weight: bold;">intangible</span>, abstract nature), so it's harder to evaluate<br />- software is more <span style="font-weight: bold;">malleable </span>(plastyczny, kowalny) than building materials, so buildings is not a good source to learn about ideas for dealing with change<br />- there's <span style="font-weight: bold;">building industry</span>, but no really such thing for software<br />- same software can be deployed <span style="font-weight: bold;">in many places</span>, buildings not really<br />- software is a machine, building's not (software's <span style="font-weight: bold;">dynamic</span>)<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">1.2 Architecture of the Web</span><br /><br />Everyone knows <span style="font-weight: bold;">WWW</span>, but how is it actually built?<br /><ul><li>from user's point of view: dynamic set of relationships among collections of information<br />--&gt; so it is: <span style="font-weight: bold;">internet browser</span> + <span style="font-weight: bold;">set of documents</span></li><li>from another point of view: dynamic collection of machines all over the world, which interact across computer networks<br />--&gt; so it is: <span style="font-weight: bold;">physical machines</span> (clients and servers)</li><li>from developer's point of view: collection of independently written programs that interact according to HTTP, URI, MIME and HTML standard rules<br />--&gt; so it is:<span style="font-weight: bold;"> physical machines</span> (clients and servers) + <span style="font-weight: bold;">documents </span>+ <span style="font-weight: bold;">interactions</span></li></ul><br />but still there's much more to it.<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">&lt;&lt;and then there comes a set of <span style="font-weight: bold;">7 rules</span> (constraints) which are supposed to clearly define what www is&gt;&gt;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">&lt;&lt;and it is also said that these rules are the <span style="font-weight: bold;">architectural style</span> of the www&gt;&gt;</span><br /><br />(...)<br /><br />The following<span style="font-weight: bold;"> observations are important:</span><br /><ul><li>the architecture of the Web is <span style="font-weight: bold;">separated </span>from the code that implements its elements; to understand the Web, the architecture is the only effective reference point!</li><li>there's<span style="font-weight: bold;"> no single piece of code</span> that implements the Web's architecture! instead we have it implemented by servers, browsers, proxies, routers, and network infrastructure;</li><li>there are pieces of code that are <span style="font-weight: bold;">equivalent </span>in view of the architecture, but implemented in totally different ways, e.g. web browsers</li><li>the constraints defining the Web are<span style="font-weight: bold;"> not apparent</span> in the code, but still are visible by all the components (nicht verstehen)</li></ul>--&gt; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Why </span>this architecture is good for Web (why it was chosen and why did it make the Web become so popular)? We'll see in Chapter 11, but for now it is important that it was the focus on architecture which made it.<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Sum up: Architecture is critical enabler for development of complex systems.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">1.3 Architecture on the desktop</span><br /><br />the following command in Linux:<br /><blockquote><span style="font-family: courier new;">ls invoices | grep -e August | sort</span></blockquote>gives sorted list of all files in invoices directory whose names include string August =&gt; to understand how it works you need to understand filters and pipes<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">&lt;&lt;and then there follows the explanation of <span style="font-weight: bold;">filters and pipes</span>, and Linux commands&gt;&gt;</span><br /><br />(...)<br /><br />The architectural style, called <span style="font-weight: bold;">pipe&amp;filter</span>, can be used in many applications then.<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Sum up: Architectural concepts can make effective the development of applications, and help in reuse (in that case reuse of the Unix filters).</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">1.4 Productivity and product lines</span><br /><br />(...)<br /><br />The challenge for the manufacturer is to produce wide range of product which consumers demands, simultaneously exploiting /wykorzystywać/ commonalities among members of the product family (reusing). Reusing is good because it makes it 1. <span style="font-weight: bold;">easier </span>and 2. more <span style="font-weight: bold;">reliable</span>.<br /><br />A problem and the solution which solves it because of focus on architecture (using <span style="font-weight: bold;">product families</span>):<br /><br />Problem: Philips TV sets would become more and more expensive because of quickly advancing technology (hardware) and software capabilities.<br /><br />Solution: they produced a steady stream of various products, containing /zatrzymywać/ their cost -&gt; they formulated a <span style="font-weight: bold;">product family</span>. The types varied along<span style="font-weight: bold;"> three dimensions</span>: price, output device, and geographical region. The main issues to address were <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">commonality</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>and <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">variability</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>of the products.<br /><br />(...)<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Sum up: Architectures are critical enablers for developing<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span></span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">product families</span><span style="font-style: italic;">, a key element of many business strategies.</span></div>
