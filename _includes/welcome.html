    <h1>Mona's learning blog</h1>

    <p>This is a blog I created to store my notes I am making while learning different topics (mostly programming-related), so that other people (including the future me) can benefit from them.
    </p>

    <p>Usually while making the notes I try to summarize the whole content I am reading, skipping the parts that are really obvious to me. If I feel that I have skipped parts that may not be obvious to other <i>sane people</i> (:P), I usually try to write in the post introduction something about my background in the topic. In that way the reader can judge whether their experiences match, and therefore whether the blog post can be useful to them.</p>

    <p>Post markings:
        <ul>
            <li><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-pencil"></span> - draft</li>
            <li><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book"></span> - summary of a book that I read (or a part of it)</li>
            <li><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-certificate"></span> - notes I took while preparing for a certification exam</li>
            <li><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-user"></span> - notes from a course that I took</li>
        </ul>
