### About

This blog was originally hosted in [Blogger](blogger.com), but since the difficulty in maintaining the code snippets there, I decided to look for another solution.

The another solution turned out to be [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) which coverts `*.md` markdown files to HTML and [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) for hosting the site. Everything is for free and everything works really well together. I honestly cannot believe how I was able to maintain my blog in any other way before.

I also keep on learning [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), which is really, really cool!

### Blog functionalities

Somehow it happened that for every problem I encountered, I could find an acceptable solution in a reasonable time, published by someone on the Web. I would like to list here the pages which I used to solve specific problems:

- Comments hosted on GitHub by Ivan Zuzak [http://ivanzuzak.info/2011/02/18/github-hosted-comments-for-github-hosted-blogs.html](http://ivanzuzak.info/2011/02/18/github-hosted-comments-for-github-hosted-blogs.html)
- Plugin-less Tag Cloud by Tobias Sj√∂sten [http://vvv.tobiassjosten.net/jekyll/jekyll-tag-cloud/](http://vvv.tobiassjosten.net/jekyll/jekyll-tag-cloud/)
- Generated Table of Contents [http://www.seanbuscay.com/blog/jekyll-toc-markdown/](http://www.seanbuscay.com/blog/jekyll-toc-markdown/)
- Search functionality by Jekyll [http://jekyll.tips/jekyll-casts/jekyll-search-using-lunr-js/](http://jekyll.tips/jekyll-casts/jekyll-search-using-lunr-js/)
- Loading CSS Spinner by @tobiasahlin [http://tobiasahlin.com/spinkit/](http://tobiasahlin.com/spinkit/)

The clickable and searchable tags I figured out myself, somehow :) (built on top of the Jekyll search article).
