### About

This blog was originally hosted in <a href="http://blogger.com" target="_blank">Blogger</a>, but since the difficulty in maintaining the code snippets there, I decided to look for another solution.

The another solution turned out to be <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> which coverts `*.md` markdown files to HTML and <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub pages</a> for hosting the site. Everything is for free and everything works really well together. I honestly cannot believe how I was able to maintain my blog in any other way before.

I also keep on learning <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>, which is really, really cool!

### Blog functionalities

Somehow it happened that for every problem I encountered, I could find an acceptable solution in a reasonable time, published by someone on the Web. I would like to list here the pages which I used to solve specific problems:

- Comments hosted on GitHub by Ivan Zuzak <a href="http://ivanzuzak.info/2011/02/18/github-hosted-comments-for-github-hosted-blogs.html" target="_blank">http://ivanzuzak.info/2011/02/18/github-hosted-comments-for-github-hosted-blogs.html</a>
- Plugin-less Tag Cloud by Tobias Sj√∂sten <a href="http://vvv.tobiassjosten.net/jekyll/jekyll-tag-cloud/" target="_blank">http://vvv.tobiassjosten.net/jekyll/jekyll-tag-cloud/</a>
- Generated Table of Contents <a href="http://www.seanbuscay.com/blog/jekyll-toc-markdown/" target="_blank">http://www.seanbuscay.com/blog/jekyll-toc-markdown/</a>
- Search functionality by Jekyll <a href="http://jekyll.tips/jekyll-casts/jekyll-search-using-lunr-js/" target="_blank">http://jekyll.tips/jekyll-casts/jekyll-search-using-lunr-js/</a>
- Loading CSS Spinner by @tobiasahlin <a href="http://tobiasahlin.com/spinkit/" target="_blank">http://tobiasahlin.com/spinkit/</a>

The clickable and searchable tags I figured out myself, somehow :) (built on top of the Jekyll search article).
